<p>Following C code is the implementation of merge sort, with the time complexity of O(nlogn). It was used in my current project to sort 148 million integers. At first I used bubbled sort, which took me hours to have the 148M integers sorted, because the time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2). After replacing the sorting algorithm with merge sort, the time of sorting reduced to less than 10 mins. Amazing improvement! Although I have heard of the importance of sorting/searching algorithm for years, it was the first time I realize the magic of algorithms. </p>
<p>The merge sort below was found in Internet. Sorry that I forgot to record the hyperlink of the webpage. Only a few changes were made by me. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><code>void Merge(int* input, long p, long r)<br />
{<br />
	long mid = floor((p + r) / 2);<br />
	long i1 = 0;<br />
	long i2 = p;<br />
	long i3 = mid + 1;</p>
<p>	// Temp array<br />
	int* temp=new int[r-p+1];</p>
<p>	// Merge in sorted form the 2 arrays<br />
	while ( i2 &lt;= mid &amp;&amp; i3 &lt;= r )<br />
		if ( input[i2] &lt; input[i3] )<br />
			temp[i1++] = input[i2++];<br />
		else<br />
			temp[i1++] = input[i3++];</p>
<p>	// Merge the remaining elements in left array<br />
	while ( i2 &lt;= mid )<br />
		temp[i1++] = input[i2++];</p>
<p>	// Merge the remaining elements in right array<br />
	while ( i3 &lt;= r )<br />
		temp[i1++] = input[i3++];</p>
<p>	// Move from temp array to master array<br />
	for ( int i = p; i &lt;= r; i++ )<br />
		input[i] = temp[i-p];</p>
<p>	delete [] temp;<br />
}</p>
<p>// inputs:<br />
//	p - the start index of array input<br />
//	r - the end index of array input<br />
void Merge_sort(int* input, long p, long r)<br />
{<br />
	if ( p &lt; r )<br />
	{<br />
		long mid = floor((p + r) / 2);<br />
		Merge_sort(input, p, mid);<br />
		Merge_sort(input, mid + 1, r);<br />
		Merge(input, p, r);<br />
	}<br />
